# CSE 373 Search Engine
<br />CSE 373 from University Of Washington Final Project: Search Engine using Page Rank
<br /><br />In short, we followed the class's instruction to build a functional search engine using the Page Rank algorithm. The algorithm could determine the relavance of each web page, and then return the most relevant webpage from users's requests. We work in a team of two to write tests and codes in a span of 2 weeks. We built the data structures(doubly linked list, hash table, priority queue using heaps) from the ground up. These data structures were also built from the previous homework from the class.
## Codes that we wrote
* src.main.java.datastructures.concrete.dictionaries.ChainedHashDictionary.java
* src.main.java.datastructures.concrete.ArrayHeap.java
* src.main.java.datastructures.concrete.DoubleLinkedList.java
* src.main.java.search.analyzers.PageRankAnalyzer.java
